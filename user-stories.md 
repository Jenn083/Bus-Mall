User Stories (MVP)

1) As a focus group participant (user), I want a webpage that displays clear instructions and images.

2) As a developer, I want to represent the image,tally,view result in a list format on the webpage, so the users can view the information.

3) As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand.

4) As a marketing research team (user), I want to be able to retrieve data efficiently so I may draft charts.
